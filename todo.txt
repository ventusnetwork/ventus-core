Do all the GUIs

add ways to gain exp and implement that into playerstats

add modules into items such as tracking bow being mountable, and player-only

think of a fun way to implement these modules


add commands:
    /tokens <pay|set|get|give|take> <player> [<amount>]
    /level <set|get> <player> [<amount>]
    /playtime <set|get> player [<amount>]

make a player profile thing that just brings up stats and some other shit

to compliment levels - add exp into the json - (nextLevel * 1000) exp to level up
Add the drill pick axe

Add mob drops [drops exp occasionally too]

Pick up people and carry - throw them using 0.99x tick mechanics for velocity
